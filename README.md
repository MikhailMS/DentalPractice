# Dental Practice Project
Group project - booking system for imaginary dental practice.
System is connected to a web server with MySQL DB via MySQL connector. 
System allows secretary to register new patients, book an appointments, see calendar with all appointments. 
Dentist and hygienist are allowed to see their appointments on calendar and add extra treatments to appointments, so it would be calculated afterwards to present a bill to client.
